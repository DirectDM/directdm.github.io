**DirectDM**: a tool for dark matter direct detection
=========

`DirectDM` is a program that matches Wilson coefficients of a relativitic EFT onto a Galilean-invariant NR EFT
valid at the nuclear scale. The program is available as a `Mathematica` package and will be available as a `python`
package shortly.


The `Mathematica` package is available from: [github.com/DirectDM/directdm-mma](https://github.com/DirectDM/directdm-mma)
